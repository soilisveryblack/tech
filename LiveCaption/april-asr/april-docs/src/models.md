There are two published English models:
* [april-english-dev-01110_en.april](https://april.sapples.net/april-english-dev-01110_en.april) - trained with numbers and punctuation
* [aprilv0_en-us.april](https://april.sapples.net/aprilv0_en-us.april) - previous model with no numbers or punctuation, spells numbers as words, often incorrectly

Some non-English models have been trained which are available for testing:
* [april-polish-dev-2_pl.april](https://april.sapples.net/april-polish-dev-2_pl.april) - Polish model, trained on Common Voice, 4.51% WER
* [april-french-dev-1_fr.april](https://april.sapples.net/april-french-dev-1_fr.april) - French model, trained on Common Voice, 8.75% WER

All models are based on RNN-T (`lstm-transducer-stateless2` recipe on icefall)
